# Crypto Dashboard UI
This code is retated to a Crypto Dashboard UI only. In Future I will enhance this by using "API's" and 
after learning backend transform this simple web app into a 'full stack web app' . 
- [web app link](v2crypto-dashboard-ui.netlify.app) 

currently this web app is contains code of UI only and i'm sure it needs imporvement and i will make sure
to create this web app to be a one of the best for UI/UX from my end.
